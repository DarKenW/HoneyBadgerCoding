Hi, my name is Dave. I am currently working for shell oil company in Houston, Texas as a data scientist. 
I have been in the field of data science for more than 5 years since being working for Axiom Tech Group,  
I am very famaliar with application of different machine learning and neural network using a variety of 
systems and methods in training algorithms. My industry experience inclues predictive analytics in consulting, marketing, 
finance, logistic area.

The Predictive Analytics Project I'm working on is supposed to enhance oil field production 
and cuts costs by finding optimal well settings and forecasting equipment failures and potential problems.Â We analyzed data 
collected from 'digital twins', a computer models replicating above and below ground oil well behavior, improved equipment 
maintenance and reduced overuse of chemical wells. 

My project is coming to its finish point, so im seeking for a new opportunity.
I hope my solid background and experience can contribute to your success.
