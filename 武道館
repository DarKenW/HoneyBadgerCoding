**Problem Solver**
Tech is just a tool for **Data Scientist**, be ready to learn anything new.
Assignment is about learning, learning to think.
Industry only care about what you did in industry.
Data > Model
业界并不在意你什么背景, 只要能做事儿就行

- UNIX Shell
Heart of interaction of computer: read evaluate print loop (REPL):
`$ pwd`
`$ ls -help`
`$ man ls`

cal some state on each of the proteins
we want to use a program some else wrote

- slow down

when can i hear back

Mock questions:
- what you been doing these years?
