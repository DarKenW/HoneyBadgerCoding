Hi, my name is Dave. I am currently working for wells fargo in san franciscon, california as a data scientist. 
I have been in the field of data science for more than 5 years since being working for Axiom Tech Group, 

The Predictive Analytics Project I'm working on is supposed to to improve the prediction of misconduct through the 
use of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.Â We gain insights gleaned from data 
were used to determine target markets and their issues, plan supply and demand of financial products and ways to 
save on costs with predictive analytics as well as reduce risk and examine strategic partnerships.
 
I am very familiar with data pipeline building and deployment of different machine learning and neural network using a variety of 
systems, these parts are what i am in charge of. My industry experience includes predictive analytics in consulting, marketing, 
finance, logistic area.

My project is wrapping up, about to hand over to devs op team. we made good progress. so i'm seeking for a new opportunity.
I hope my solid background and experience can contribute to your success.
